# Labor-Market-Analysis- (Currently In Progress)
This project is a labor market analysis of 'traditional' large Fortune 500 companies vs startups / big tech firms. The project attempts to gain further insight into some of the main factors that differentiate large to small comapnies in their hiring process and talent pool, regarding: salaries, job location, titles and benefits.

Data Collection: Data was collected with requests and bs4 with python, from Indeed and various other job sites in order to gather information on job postings, benefits and salaries. Bots were also used to scrape from the largest 100 tech companies in the United States. All of the data that was collected is based on user input and does not come directly from persepctive employers.
